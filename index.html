    <h1>why we should explore the universe.</h1>
    <p> this is why we should become a spacefaring civilization as fast as possible.</p>

    <h2> part 1, subscribe to nasa and spacex and unsubscribe from flat earthers!</h2>
    <p>why we should subscribe to nasa is that we can get a better life from nasa.
      nasa will gain about 10-12 subs during your avrage read time of 5 mins.
      but i think that's way too low like way too low.
      so do your part and subscribe to nasa for a better life and eternal future of humanity!
      with spacex, we should subscribe to them too.
      we know we must subscribe to spacex as they have lower subs than nasa does. IN MUSK WE TRUST!
      now i am talking about the negitives.
      a channel is called jake the asshole and he has 34,000 subscribers.
      they upload videos that disgust me. a lot.
      i hate them and i have put dislike on evryone of them.
      the worst thing about him is that they have uploaded a video called mars landing debnkned: insight 100 percent fake.
      but who is doing fake?
      of course! it's jake the asshole! so unsubscribe from flat earthers, and subscribe to science, nasa and spacex.</p>
    <h2>part 2: don't spend too much on useless stuff.</h2>
    <p>the us goverment spends 750 billion $$ a year on the useless military. but a manned mission to mars will only cost $30 billion.
      the goverment literlly spends too much on the useless military and dosen't even consider funding space exploration.
      but we must spend more on space exploration.
      the goverment can't get away with spending too much on uselless stuff.
      anyways, tell the goverment to spend more on space exploration.</p>
    <h2>part 3, forget the wall! bulid a dyson sphere! </h2>
    <p>while it might sound crazy, buliding a dyson sphere is very benefical!</p>
